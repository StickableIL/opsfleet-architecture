The proposed architecture leverages AWS managed services with a multi-account strategy, containerized applications on Amazon EKS, and robust security for handling sensitive user data.

## 1. Cloud Environment Structure

### Recommended AWS Account Strategy

We recommend a **4-account structure** following AWS best practices:

#### Production Account (`innovate-prod`)
- **Purpose**: Hosts production workloads and customer-facing services
- **Resources**: Production EKS cluster, Multi-AZ RDS PostgreSQL, production VPC
- **Justification**: Complete isolation ensures production stability and security

#### Development/Staging Account (`innovate-dev`)
- **Purpose**: Development, testing, and staging environments
- **Resources**: Smaller EKS cluster, single-AZ RDS for cost optimization
- **Justification**: Prevents development activities from affecting production

#### Shared Services Account (`innovate-shared`)
- **Purpose**: Common services shared across environments
- **Resources**: Amazon ECR repositories, AWS Secrets Manager, shared tooling
- **Justification**: Centralized management reduces duplication and costs

#### Security/Audit Account (`innovate-security`)
- **Purpose**: Centralized logging, monitoring, and compliance
- **Resources**: AWS CloudTrail, AWS Config, CloudWatch Logs aggregation
- **Justification**: Independent security monitoring ensures compliance

### Benefits
- **Blast Radius Limitation**: Issues in one account don't affect others
- **Granular Billing**: Clear cost attribution per environment
- **Enhanced Security**: Account-level isolation provides strong boundaries
- **Compliance**: Easier regulatory compliance with clear separation

## 2. Network Design

### VPC Architecture

![Network Architecture](network_architecture_-_multi-az_setup.png)

#### Production VPC (`10.0.0.0/16`)

**Public Subnets** (Internet-facing):
- `10.0.1.0/24` - AZ-A (ALB, NAT Gateway)
- `10.0.2.0/24` - AZ-B (NAT Gateway)

**Private Subnets** (Applications):
- `10.0.10.0/24` - AZ-A (EKS nodes)
- `10.0.11.0/24` - AZ-B (EKS nodes)

**Database Subnets** (Data layer):
- `10.0.20.0/24` - AZ-A (RDS primary)
- `10.0.21.0/24` - AZ-B (RDS standby)

### Network Security

**Defense in Depth Strategy:**
- **Security Groups**: Stateful rules controlling traffic between components
- **Network ACLs**: Additional subnet-level protection for database tier
- **VPC Flow Logs**: Comprehensive network traffic monitoring
- **AWS WAF**: Web application firewall protecting against common threats
- **Private Subnets**: Applications have no direct internet access
- **NAT Gateways**: Controlled outbound internet access for updates and APIs

## 3. Compute Platform

### Amazon EKS Configuration

![Kubernetes Architecture](kubernetes_application_architecture.png)

#### EKS Cluster Setup
- **Version**: Kubernetes 1.28
- **Control Plane**: Managed by AWS with full logging enabled
- **Networking**: AWS VPC CNI for native VPC integration
- **Security**: Private API endpoint with restricted public access
- **Encryption**: Envelope encryption using AWS KMS

### Node Groups Strategy

#### Frontend Node Group (React SPA)
- **Instance Types**: t3.medium (primary), with spot instances for cost optimization
- **Scaling**: 2-20 nodes based on demand
- **Workload**: Serves static React application via nginx
- **Resource Profile**: Low CPU/memory requirements

#### Backend Node Group (Flask API)
- **Instance Types**: t3.large (primary), scalable to m5.large for performance
- **Scaling**: 2-50 nodes based on API load
- **Workload**: Python Flask REST API services
- **Resource Profile**: Higher CPU/memory for API processing

### Scaling and Resource Allocation

**Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**:
- Frontend: Scale based on 70% CPU utilization (3-50 replicas)
- Backend: Scale based on 70% CPU + 80% memory (3-100 replicas)

**Cluster Autoscaler**:
- Automatically adjusts node count based on pod scheduling needs
- Optimizes costs by scaling down underutilized nodes
- Considers spot instance availability for cost savings

**Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)**:
- Provides resource optimization recommendations
- Ensures right-sizing of container resource requests/limits

### Containerization Strategy

#### Image Management
- **Registry**: Amazon ECR with vulnerability scanning
- **Build Process**: Multi-stage Docker builds for optimization
- **Security**: Non-root containers with minimal base images
- **Lifecycle**: Automated cleanup of old images to control costs

#### Deployment Process
- **Strategy**: Rolling updates with blue-green capability
- **Health Checks**: Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes
- **Security Context**: Pod security standards enforcement
- **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory constraints for stability

## 4. Database Strategy

### Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL

#### Configuration
- **Engine**: PostgreSQL 15.4 with managed updates
- **Instance**: Start with db.t3.medium, scale to db.r6g.large
- **Multi-AZ**: Enabled for high availability
- **Storage**: GP3 SSD with encryption at rest
- **Network**: Private subnets only, no public access

#### High Availability

- **Read Replicas**: Up to 5 replicas for read scaling
- **Connection Pooling**: PgBouncer for connection management
- **Backup Strategy**: 7-day automated backups with point-in-time recovery

#### Scaling Strategy
